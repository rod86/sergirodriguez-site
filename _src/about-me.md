I am Sergi Rodriguez, a web developer specialised in HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, Responsive web design and PHP.

I am self-motivated, hard worker with a “can do” attitude and a good team player. I am always keeping myself updated with the latest webs trends reading books and articles.

I have studied training courses about Networking and Applications Development in Barcelona where I was introduced to networking and programing languages like Basic.Net, C#.Net, ASP 3.0 and PHP.
Finally I ended starting to work with open source web technologies like PHP and MySQL in several companies in Barcelona, most of them digital agencies. During this period, I changed job a few times and I learned different ways to work and adapt to different types and sizes of teams.
